| Dec 2  |  1:45pm - 2:15pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    During this class period we discussed some initial approaches to this problem. One approach was using a frequency list to keep track of the most common words and then replace them with a short 5 bit code. |

| Dec 5  | 10:45pm - 11:05pm | I thought a bit further about the solution about and my idea which I will execute starting tomorrow is this: I will split the string by a space delimiter then create a frequency list of which words we see most often. Then I'd potentially store the top 20% of candidates and compress those. Additionally, i'd compress every other char to a 5-bit code as we only have upper case letters and lowercase letters and select punctuations. |

I than began discussing with my table mates how we would use the Trie and the best way to use it to store codes and search up prefixs. |

I met with Mr. Blick to discuss how to use getLongestPrefix as a solution to this problem set. |

Although I don't fully yet know if this code works due to not havivng expansion done yet. |
