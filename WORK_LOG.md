| Dec 2  |  1:45pm - 2:15pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          During this class period we discussed some initial approaches to this problem. One approach was using a frequency list to keep track of the most common words and then replace them with a short 5 bit code. |
| Dec 4  | 12:35pm - 1:15pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I talked more about this solution with Landon Tony and Isha and we discussed using a hashmap to store and concisely give the most common text findings. |
| Dec 5  | 10:45pm - 11:05pm |                                       I thought a bit further about the solution about and my idea which I will execute starting tomorrow is this: I will split the string by a space delimiter then create a frequency list of which words we see most often. Then I'd potentially store the top 20% of candidates and compress those. Additionally, i'd compress every other char to a 5-bit code as we only have upper case letters and lowercase letters and select punctuations. |

I than began discussing with my table mates how we would use the Trie and the best way to use it to store codes and search up prefix. |
| Dec 10 |  9:20am - 9:55am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I than began coding and got down the main logic of my code, I now just need to add when I get a prefix and add it to the trie / print it out. |
| Dec 11 |  2:10pm - 2:40pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      During this I worked on finishing my compression. I met with Mr. Blick to discuss how to use getLongestPrefix as a solution to this problem set. |
| Dec 11 |  2:40pm - 3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             During the end of this class I finished up the code and tested it, achieving a compression ratio of 82% on abra. Although I don't fully yet know if this code works due to not having expansion done yet. |
| Dec 12 | 9:30pm - 10:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           During this session I coded my expansion algorithm and tested it. However, it didn't work as I ended up having my expansion actually compress my file more. |
| Dec 12 | 10:00pm - 10:30pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                        To trace this issue I carefully went through my expansion algorithm and figured out that I wasn't checking for the tricky case quite as well or for checking if we are out of bounds / reading in null data. After fixing this issue my expansion algorithm still didn't work. |
| Dec 12 | 11:00pm - 11:30pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I ended up re-coding and deleting my expand algorithm and thinking through the logic again. I seemingly got it working however my compress algorithm seemed to be not working correctly so I remade it as well. |
| Dec 12 | 11:30pm - 12:00pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 During this session I re-made my compression algorithm and it worked, acheiving a compression ratio of 43% on alice. However, when I tried to expand again I ran into a null pointer exception error. |
| Dec 12 | 12:00pm - 12:30pm | During this session I got my code working (I'm so happy Mr. Blick, I've spent around the last 3 hours debugging and it finally worked). My issue all along was that I wasn't exiting adding condition if there wasn't enough room left in the codes. Additionally, one other error I had is where nextCode points to an null objectâ€”when i try to access it I get the nullpointerexception. After fixing all of these and thoroughly testing my code it works on every test case now! |
| Dec 12 | 12:30pm - 12:45pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Commented code and fixed some syntax / spacing for more readability. |
