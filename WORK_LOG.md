One approach was using a frequency list to keep track of the most common words and then replace them with a short 5 bit code. |

| Dec 5 | 10:45pm - 11:05pm |  I thought a bit further about the solution about and my idea which I will execute starting tomorrow is this: I will split the string by a space delimiter then create a frequency list of which words we see most often. Then I'd potentially store the top 20% of candidates and compress those. Additionally, i'd compress every other char to a 5-bit code as we only have upper case letters and lowercase letters and select punctuations. |
